        Accuracy measured is overall classification accuracy on the ModelNet40
        test set. Left: Point deletion based on different sampling strategies,
        random and furthest sampling, up to the 1024 original points. Middle:
        Insertion of uniformly scattered outliers in the canonicalized unit
        sphere of the original shape. Right: Adding perturbation in the form of
        Gaussian noise with mean 0 to each point in the unit sphere independently.
